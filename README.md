Hello, I am Çağlar. I am a doctor with years of education in the field of medicine. 
I work as a General Surgeon. I started getting interested in software since the beginning of 2023. 
What I enjoy the most in life is creating something new. 
The most important drive that encourages me to learn software is to bring to life ideas that have never been tried before and that haven't crossed anyone's mind. 
While trying to escape from mundane office tasks, I found myself immersed in the world of software. 
One of the most important aspects for me is finding shortcuts and bringing new ideas to life. 
I am currently working on improving myself, but I would like to collaborate with friends who excel in Python. 
My goal is not to join a major project (I am aware that this would teach me a lot). 
My goal is to bring the ideas in my mind to life.
